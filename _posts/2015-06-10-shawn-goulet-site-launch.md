Shout out to [@jmcglone](https://github.com/jmcglone) for the killer [documentation](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) helping me finally put my 1st site together. Thanks for your awesome documentation.  This site is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I use Markdown to author my posts. I recommend it and look forward to building this site further soon!
